//! Add class to the button

//! Add event listener to the button

//! Add text to the button

//! Change the completion status of the todo item

//! Create a new completion status element

//! Create button

//! Get the completion status element

//! Replace the old completion status element with the new one -- This is currently not working because the function CANT find the old element. I think it's because the old element is not a child of the todoCard.
